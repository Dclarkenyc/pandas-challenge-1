# pandas-challenge-1
##
### Description:
The assignment was to use python pandas to analyze an e-commerce company and 
identfy things such as top customers and calculating profits.

### Usage:
Run the file wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb

### Resources:
The completed assignment is the folder pandas-challenge-1 in the file menu_py. The resource file - client dataset.csv was  provided with the assignement. 

### Known Issues:
I had trouble with the last 2 questions.  For some reason related to one of the 
fields I created I could not get the final totals to print in dataframe format 
even though running info confirmed it was a dataframe.  I am not sure if the last
two questions didn't run because of the same issue or if they would have run if
I had been able to fix the database issue mentioned above.  I messed up total purchased.  

### Acknowledgements:
I tried to work with Xpert Learning Assitant to help with the above issues 
but it said pointed out the error with total purchased and i could not fix without messing up the file.
