# pandas-challenge-1
##
### Description:
The assignment was to use python pandas to analyze an e-commerce company and 
identfy things such as top customers and calculating profits.

### Usage:
Run the file wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb

### Resources:
The completed assignment is the folder pandas-challenge-1 in the file menu_py. 
The resource file - client dataset.csv was  provided with the assignment. 

### Known Issues:
I had trouble with the last few questions.  For some reason the dataframe in [22]
has an unfamiliar format - there are borders and it can be resized.  I did get some
help from the learning assistant - but I can't see anything in the code that is 
different. 

### Acknowledgements:
I tried to work with Xpert Learning Assitant to help with the above issues 
but it said pointed out the error with total purchased and i could not fix without messing up the file.
